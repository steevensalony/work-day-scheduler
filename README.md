## Description

A simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a work day

This was a challenge given by our bootcamp instructors

## Instalation

To install this code, simply click on the url to my repository [https://github.com/steevensalony/work-day-scheduler] and clone the ssh key to your local machine. 
this is also the link to the website https://steevensalony.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

The main use of this is to be able to add important events to a daily planner as an employer or employee so that you can manage your time effectively. You'd be able to add what you plan on doing at a certain hour of your work day and save it, then be able to come back to it later for reference even after you've closed your browser.
